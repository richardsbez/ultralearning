## What is UltraLearn?

UltraLearn is a desktop application that helps you deliberately track your learning across the 9 principles of ultralearning — Metalearning, Focus, Direct Practice, Drilling, Retrieval, Feedback, Retention, Intuition, and Experimentation. Each subject you study gets its own space with checklists, progress bars, a visual roadmap canvas, a resource library, and free notes.

The app is inspired by the book Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career (Hardcover, Illustrated, August 6, 2019), written by Scott H. Young with a foreword by James Clear.

Everything is saved as plain Markdown files (`.ul.md`) in a folder of your choice — readable in any text editor or Obsidian.

## Features

### 📋 9-Principle Tracker

- Each of the 9 ultralearning principles has an editable checklist with 7 items
- Add, edit, and remove checklist items per principle
- Progress bars per principle and overall score
- "Reviewed today" button with staleness alerts after 7+ days without review

### 🗺️ Visual Roadmap Canvas

Full-featured interactive canvas inspired by Obsidian Canvas:

- **5 node types:** default steps, checklists, text notes (post-its), images, and groups/frames
- Pan, zoom (scroll), multi-select (Shift+drag), box select
- Smart 4-directional Bezier arrows with click-to-delete
- Connect mode for drawing relationships between nodes
- Undo/Redo (60 states), Copy/Paste, Duplicate
- Snap to grid, minimap, fit-view
- Context menu with 7-color palette
- Drag & drop images directly onto the canvas

### 📚 Resource Library

Card-based library with multi-attachment support per resource:

- **9 resource types:** Book, Course, Video, Article, Link, PDF, Image, Audio, Other
- Attach **multiple files per resource** — mix 2 PDFs + 3 images + 2 audio files in a single card
- Images open fullscreen in-app
- PDFs open with the system's default PDF reader
- Audio plays with an in-app player
- Filter by type, status badges (queued / in use / done)

### 📝 Free Notes

Per-subject textarea for general notes, links, and insights.

### 🌍 4 Languages

Full UI translation including all 9 principle names, checklist items, and all roadmap strings:

- 🇧🇷 Portuguese
- 🇺🇸 English
- 🇪🇸 Spanish
- 🇨🇳 Chinese

Switch language from the topbar — only the selected language is loaded at startup (lazy loading). The app reloads and applies the new language without losing any data.

### 💾 Auto-save & Data Safety

- Debounced auto-save (300ms after any change)
- Synchronous flush before window close or language reload — no data loss
- Files saved as standard YAML front-matter Markdown, compatible with Obsidian

### 🎬 Boot Screen

Animated terminal-style loading sequence showing all 9 principles initializing on startup.

## The 9 Ultralearning Principles

This app is built around the framework from **Ultralearning** by Scott H. Young (2019):

| # | Principle | Core Idea |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Metalearning** | Research how to learn the subject before diving in |
| 2 | **Focus** | Fight procrastination and maintain quality concentration |
| 3 | **Direct Practice** | Practice in the real context where you'll use the skill |
| 4 | **Drilling** | Isolate and attack weak sub-skills directly |
| 5 | **Retrieval** | Test yourself actively instead of passively reviewing |
| 6 | **Feedback** | Seek honest, frequent feedback on your performance |
| 7 | **Retention** | Ensure what you learn stays long-term |
| 8 | **Intuition** | Understand deeply from first principles, don't just memorize |
| 9 | **Experimentation** | Explore different methods and develop your own style |
